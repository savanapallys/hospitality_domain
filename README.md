AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis
In this project I've created a dashboard using power BI ,for the revenue management team of AtliQ Grand hotel chain, which can provide key insights on Revenue trend.

Problem Statement :
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

Task :
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.

Create the metrics according to the metric list.

Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.

Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

Tools :
power BI - for data cleaning and visualization.
Step by Step Process :
Imported and transformed data in Power BI.
I've used Power Query to connect to input folder and expanded CSV files.
Performed data transformation and established relationships in data modeling.
Created calculated columns and measures in Power BI.
And then I've Created few filters and key performance indicators.
Finally created dashboard using appropriate visualization.

Insights :
From the visualization i.e., Trends by Key Metrics we can see that Mumbai city is generating highest Revenue and the Delhi city generating lowest Revenue,So now we take actions accordingly.
And if we observe Average Rating the AtliQ Exotica property has highest rating meanwhile AtliQ Seasons has lowest rating.
If we see the Revenue % by Category ,the Revenue from the Luxury Category is more than the Businees Category.
If we apply the room_class filter then we can see that Elite class is generating high revenue among all classes.
If we check monthly ,then the highest revenue was generated in the month of May.
Things I've learned from this project :
I've got the hospitality domain knowledge ,and yeah having domain knowledge is really important and that will be helpful to full fill the requirements of stakeholders.

And I've got to know few important key metrics which plays an important role in hotel revenue performance like

Revenue per available room (RevPar)
Average Daily Rate (ADR)
Occupancy %
Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)
Realisation %
In order to create these KPI's ,I've learnt the effective usage of DAX.

Understanding the requirements of business based on the data and learnt how to ask right questions to stakeholders in order to prepare an effective dashboard.

And proper usage of color palettes for creating dashboards.



For a hospitality Power BI project, you can use dashboard names like "Hotel Performance Dashboard," "Hospitality Key Metrics," or "Revenue & Occupancy Analyzer," as these clearly indicate the project's domain and the insights it provides, focusing on metrics such as RevPAR, ADR, occupancy, and revenue.
